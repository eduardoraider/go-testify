# Testify

Testify is a popular testing toolkit for Go. It provides a set of helper functions and assertions that make writing tests easier and more expressive.

## Installation

To install Testify, use `go get`:


```
go get github.com/stretchr/testify
```

Run your tests using the go test command: 
```
go test
```

This will execute all the tests in your project and display the results.
